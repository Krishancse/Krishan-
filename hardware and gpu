Optimizing deep learning frameworks for hardware and GPUs involves configuring the framework to make effective use of GPU resources and applying techniques to accelerate computations. Below is a simple example of how you can set up TensorFlow to run on a GPU and enable mixed precision training for optimization.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import experimental as mixed_precision

# Check if a GPU is available
if tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print('GPU available.')
else:
    print('No GPU available. Please check your TensorFlow installation.')

# Enable mixed precision training
policy = mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
mixed_precision.set_policy(policy)

# Create a simple neural network model
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model with mixed precision optimizer
opt = Adam(learning_rate=1e-3)
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=opt, metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load dataset (MNIST as an example)
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Convert the model to float32 for inference
model = tf.keras.models.clone_model(model)
model.set_weights(model.get_weights())
```

In this example:
- We check if a GPU is available using TensorFlow's GPU detection functionality.
- We enable mixed precision training using TensorFlow's mixed precision API to optimize GPU memory usage and computation.
- We create a simple neural network model and compile it with an optimizer.
- The model is trained on the MNIST dataset with mixed precision enabled.
- Finally, we convert the trained model to float32 for inference.

Remember that for more complex models and real-world optimization, you might need to consider data loading, distributed training, advanced GPU features, and additional optimization strategies.
  Also, the availability of GPUs and their features can vary based on your hardware and TensorFlow installation.
